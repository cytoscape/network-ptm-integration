# network-ptm-integration
This repo tracks the work of phosphoproteome data-driven addition of phosphorylation sites to proteins in networks (and pathways). The idea is to create an interactive tool where users can visualize data on relevant phospho sites on pathways. Phospho sites can be visualized in multiple ways: an oval offset from the parent node for each phospho site, or as a pie chart offset from the node visualizing all phospho sites (idea from CPTAC group). The user could choose to visualize all sites in the data, or restrict the sites added based on various methods/data (relevant kinases/phosphatase on the pathway, pan-cancer PROGENy data, inhibitor data).
