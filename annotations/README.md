## Phosphorylation site dataset
From PSP: sequences surrounding the PTMs (+/- 7 AAs), gene symbols, accession IDs, site group IDs, molecular weights, number of associated records, and Cell Signaling Technology catalog numbers where available. Separate files for each modification type including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, methylation, O-glycosylation, sumoylation, etc.

Comments: 
- This is the same information as the Site Table (for example https://www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.action?id=570&showAllSites=true)
- Relevant columns: GENE, PROTEIN, ACC_ID, MOD-RSD, SITE_GRP_ID, ORGANISM, DOMAIN, SITE		 

## Regulatory sites
From PSP: Information curated from the literature about modification sites shown to regulate molecular functions, biological processes, and molecular interactions including protein-protein interactions.

## Kinase-substrate dataset
From PSP: experimentally determined substrates, sequences, cognate kinases, and metadata curated from the literature
